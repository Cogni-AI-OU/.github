# GitHub Workflows and Actions

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows and related configuration.

## Workflows

### Check Workflow

The `check.yml` workflow runs on pull requests, pushes, and weekly schedule to
ensure code quality and correctness.

Jobs:

- **actionlint**: Validates GitHub Actions workflow files
- **link-checker**: Checks for broken links in Markdown files using Lychee
- **pre-commit**: Runs pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting

#### Link Checker

The link checker job uses [Lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) to
scan all Markdown files for broken links. It includes caching to avoid rate
limits and can be configured via `.lycheeignore` at the repository root to
exclude specific URLs or patterns.

**Local Testing**: You can test links locally using `linkcheckmd` (a Python
alternative to Lychee):

```bash
# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r .devcontainer/requirements.txt

# Check a single file
python -m linkcheckmd path/to/file.md

# Check all markdown files in a directory
python -m linkcheckmd .
```

The tool checks both local file references and remote URLs, making it easy to
catch broken links before pushing changes.

## Problem Matchers

GitHub Actions problem matchers automatically annotate files with errors and
warnings in pull requests, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

### Available Matchers

- **actionlint-matcher.json**: Captures errors from actionlint workflow linting
- **pre-commit-matcher.json**: Captures errors from pre-commit hooks

### Pre-commit Problem Matcher

The pre-commit problem matcher supports two output formats:

1. **Generic format** (`file:line:col: message`): Used by flake8, actionlint,
   and other tools that provide column information
2. **No-column format** (`file:line message`): Used by markdownlint and other
   tools that only provide line numbers

Note: Some hooks like yamllint and ansible-lint already output GitHub Actions
annotations directly and don't need the problem matcher.

### Configuration

Problem matchers are registered in the `.github/workflows/check.yml` workflow
before running the corresponding tools.
