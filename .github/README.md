# GitHub Workflows and Actions

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows and related configuration.

## Workflow Templates

The `workflow-templates/` directory contains reference workflows that are not
actively executed but are preserved for future use or copying to other
repositories. These templates can be customized and moved to the `workflows/`
directory when needed.

## Problem Matchers

GitHub Actions problem matchers automatically annotate files with errors and
warnings in pull requests, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

### Available Matchers

- **actionlint-matcher.json**: Captures errors from actionlint workflow linting
- **pre-commit-matcher.json**: Captures errors from pre-commit hooks

### Pre-commit Problem Matcher

The pre-commit problem matcher supports two output formats:

1. **Generic format** (`file:line:col: message`): Used by flake8, actionlint,
   and other tools that provide column information
2. **No-column format** (`file:line message`): Used by markdownlint and other
   tools that only provide line numbers

Note: Some hooks like yamllint and ansible-lint already output GitHub Actions
annotations directly and don't need the problem matcher.

### Configuration

Problem matchers are registered in the `.github/workflows/check.yml` workflow
before running the corresponding tools.

### Using Matchers in Reusable Workflows

When using the `check.yml` workflow as a reusable workflow (via `workflow_call`),
the matcher files are automatically provided from this repository. You don't need
to copy the matcher files to your repository.

If you want to use custom matcher files, you can specify them using the inputs:

```yaml
jobs:
  check:
    uses: Cogni-AI-OU/.github/.github/workflows/check.yml@main
    with:
      actionlint-matcher-path: .github/custom-actionlint-matcher.json
      pre-commit-matcher-path: .github/custom-pre-commit-matcher.json
```

If these inputs are not provided, the workflow will automatically use the default
matcher files from this repository.

## Security

### Claude Workflow Git Access

The Claude Code workflow (`claude.yml`) grants intentionally broad git access
via `Bash(git:*)` to enable autonomous code changes. This permission is necessary
for Claude to commit and push changes, but requires proper safeguards.

#### Security Controls

**Access Control:**

- Only trusted users can trigger Claude (OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR, CONTRIBUTOR)
- PR/issue authors can only trigger on their own content
- External contributors (FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR, NONE) are explicitly blocked

**Required Repository Protections:**

To safely use Claude with git access, repository administrators must configure:

1. **Branch Protection Rules** on main/protected branches:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass (e.g., linting, tests)
   - Require conversation resolution before merging
   - Do not allow bypassing the above settings

2. **GitHub Audit Logs** (organization-level):
   - Enable and regularly review audit logs
   - Monitor commits made by `github-actions[bot]` (Claude's identity)
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns (rapid commits, deleted branches, etc.)

3. **Protected Branch Policies**:
   - Restrict who can push to protected branches
   - Consider requiring deployment approvals for production branches
   - Use CODEOWNERS to require specific reviewer approval for sensitive files

#### Best Practices

- Review Claude's commits before merging PRs
- Use draft PRs for Claude's work to require explicit promotion
- Regularly audit Claude's tool usage and permissions
- Rotate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` periodically
- Monitor workflow run logs for unexpected behavior
